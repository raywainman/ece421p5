Remarks/Discussion Required:
-Need to make sure no duplicate players in same game?
-Need to make sure same player isn't in multiple games?
-Make sure you cannot restore a game that is in progress (eliminated by previous one)
-Make sure you pull a new INSTANCE of the object IN EVERY THREAD! (according to what I've read, if you try to use connections between threads in ruby it will randomly close for no reason - same issue as sqlite...)
-No exception handling at this point..., was just worried about getting functionality so I'm not a blocker for anyone
